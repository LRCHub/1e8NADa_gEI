[00:12.42] Watch the blood get spilled
[00:14.97] You can kill, or you can be killed
[00:17.99] It doesn't really matter what i feel
[00:19.96] I would rather fake than make the pain real
[00:23.06] Oh, take that smirk, wipe it off your face
[00:25.64] You would do the same shit if it let you change your fate
[00:28.75] If life is nothing but an endless race
[00:31.61] You bet your ass im getting first place
[00:34.59] Please somebody get me out of here
[00:37.35] Oh please somebody wont you get me out of here, oh!
[00:41.80] You can get me out of here!
[00:45.94] Yep, thats right, let your dreams take flight
[00:48.39] Watch the line go up, line go up, up up up up up
[00:50.92] Until it breaks right through, blows a hole through you
[00:53.77] You can fill it up, fill it up, fu- fu- fill it up
[00:56.66] And all the meat will slide off the bone, so nice
[00:59.47] You can eat it up, eat it up, eat eat eat eat eat
[01:02.13] Until you're full of life, its a goddamn vibe
[01:04.96] Baby, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
[01:07.63] Oh we can fuck until the sun burns out
[01:09.82] We can rot for clout
[01:16.64] Die upon your hill
[01:18.80] I live apart from love and goodwill
[01:21.51] And when the pain comes calling for my head
[01:24.12] Yeah i would rather hurt than be happy and dead
[01:27.23] Oh, fuck your frown, baby, spare your grace
[01:29.94] Now i'm wearing my crown, perfect framing of my face
[01:33.20] All the detail surgically replaced
[01:35.09] It's a crying shame, a pathetic disgrace
[01:38.98] Please somebody get me out of here
[01:41.36] Oh please somebody wont you get me out of here, oh!
[01:45.81] I'm not getting out of here!
[01:50.04] That's right, let your dreams take flight
[01:52.45] Watch the line go up, line go up, up up up up up
[01:55.07] Until it breaks right through, blows a hole through you
[01:57.99] You can fill it up, fill it up, fi- fiu- fill it up
[02:00.78] And all the meat deep-fried with a garnish and side
[02:03.60] You can eat it up, eat it up, eat eat eat eat eat
[02:06.09] Until you're full of life, on the edge of the knife
[02:09.16] Baby, cut it up, cut it up, fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck it
[02:11.94] Oh god, a waking nightmare
[02:14.79] I live a life so hollow that i'm not even there
[02:17.39] Oh god, the light won't save me
[02:20.24] Oh i'm a perfect tempered instrument and life is gonna play me
[02:23.10] Come and fuck me till the sun burns out
[02:25.26] And I rot for-
[02:26.29] Maybe not a single real reason
[02:28.77] My blood's already out of season
[02:31.39] So unwanted, even by myself
[02:33.85] Tell me; what the hell? what the hell?
[02:36.61] I don't like what's at my core
[02:39.42] Pray to god to fix my soul
[02:42.20] But i don't need god's forgiveness
[02:45.12] I need yours
[03:08.42] That's right, let your dreams take flight
[03:10.61] Watch the line go up, line go up, up up up up up
[03:13.24] Until it breaks right through, blows a hole through you
[03:16.15] You can fill it up, fill it up, fu- fu- fill it up
[03:18.80] And all the meat shall grind into pretty pink slime
[03:21.82] You can eat it up, eat it up, eat eat eat eat eat
[03:24.32] Until you're full of life, cut yourself up with the knife
[03:27.36] Baby, cut it up, cut it up, fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck it
[03:30.02] Oh god, a waking nightmare
[03:32.86] I live a life so miserable, it isn't fair
[03:35.80] Oh god, the light won't save me
[03:38.29] So let the anthropocene watch me GOING FUCKING CRAZY
[03:41.15] Come and fuck me till the sun burns out
[03:43.59] And I rot for clout
